# Event Scheduler Application

## Description

This application uses HTML, CSS and Javascript with API to provide a useful application for busy coders!
This scheduling planner allows you to enter events, it saves the events to local storage, and upon reloading it displays the events.
It features color coded day slots according to the current time and also displays the current date at the top of the page.
I built this page to learn more about how APIs function and how to store things remotely and locally using Javascript and jQuery.
